<h2>Jam Games</h2>
<div class="reel">
    <div>
        <h3>Coinks↘<time> (2023)</time></h3>
        <p>A tiny city-building puzzle. With the jam theme "Roles Reversed", the catch was that you have to lose money as quickly as possible.
            The nice little optimal strategy that people usually only discover on the first attempt is to just buy expensive buildings instead of
            just using a money-burning one.
            <br><br> I was a designer and a programmer in a team of 7.
            <br><br> The game scored 683/6828.

        <h3>GOBLINOMICON<time> (2023)</time></h3>
        <p>A game where you choose one of the three cards to put on a field and change its tiles.
            <br><br> I was a game designer and a programmer in a team of 7.
            <br><br> The game scored 6/138.

        <h3>railless!<time> (2023)</time></h3>
        <p>A fun game little driving game where you drift with a train locomotive. When drifting, you can pickup stray wagons
            and destroy obstacles; the more wagons you have, the more challenging it is to pickup a new one. The difficulty
            was too much, though.
            <br><br> I did everything but the audio.
            <br><br> The game scored 584/1720.

        <h3>babls!!<time> (2022)</time></h3>
        <p>A sokoban-like puzzle where you can duplicate your bubbles to clean up all the dirt on the board. Levels turned out pretty challenging
            while being short, I'm pretty happy with those.
            <br><br> I did everything but the audio.
            <br><br> The game scored 97/1066.
