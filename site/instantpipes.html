<h1>Instant Pipes</h1>
<p>An editor tool for procedurally generating pipes by just dragging the cursor from start to end — the pipe will find the path in a customizable way.</p>

<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<p>Unity 2021.3 or higher.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Add the package to your project via the <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui.html">Package Manager</a> using the Git URL
    <span>https://github.com/letharqic/InstantPipes.git</span>. You can also clone the repository and point the Package Manager to your local copy.
</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Starting out</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Create an empty GameObject and set its world position to zero.</li>
    <li>Add a <span>Pipe Generator</span> component.</li>
    <li>Select a material for the <span>Material</span> property.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ctrl+Z works with all actions. When you're commited to the pipes, you can just remove the component, the mesh will stay.</p>
<h3>Pipes Settings</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span>Curvature</span> changes the length of the curved parts, making pipes appear more or less curvy. Note that it applies after pathfinding, so in some cases high
        curvature value can make pipes intersect.
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>Edges</span> property selects how many edges the pipes will have, and <span>Segments</span> is the amount of subdivisions in curved parts.
    </li>
    <li>You can toggle <span>Rings</span> and <span>End Caps</span> and separately set up their radius and thickness.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Using pathfinding</h3>
<p>In the component inspector, select the <span>Create</span> tab. Now in the scene view start dragging your cursor where you want the pipe to start, end let go where you want it
    to end; a pipe will appear.</p>
<p>The tool uses A* pathfinding without a predefined grid — by raycasting from a point to the next points. Pipes can only detect colliders as obstacles.</p>

<h3>Manual Editing</h3>
<p>In the component inspector, select the <span>Edit</span> tab. Select one of the points in the scene view by clicking on it, and then you can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Move the selected points in the scene view</li>
    <li>Input the exact positions for the selected points in the inspector</li>
    <li>Delete the point or the entire pipe via a button in the inspector</li>
    <li>Insert a new point via a button in the inspector</li>
</ul>
<p>Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> to select multiple points. Press <kbd>A</kbd> to select every point of the selected pipe.</p>
<p>Every pipe is a separate submesh, so you can assign separate materials by dragging them into the scene view.</p>
