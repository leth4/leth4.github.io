<h1>Game Design Portfolio</h1>
<h2>Project DeepWeb<time> (2020)</time></h2>

<p>A narrative adventure game about exploring deep corners of the internet. It features a semi-linear storyline of going deeper and deeper to save
    someone, and has a lot of little side character stories, discovered through their websites and dialogue logs. There's puzzle elements every
    once in a while, too.</p>
<p><b>Responsibilities:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>As a game designer, made most decisions on how the game is supposed to work.</li>
    <li>Created the original concept and the proposal.</li>
    <li>Managed social media, wrote all promotional and update texts.</li>
    <li>Either wrote or edited over a hundred in-game websites and 150 text files.</li>
</ul>

    <div>
        <h3>Cement<time> (2023)</time></h3>
        <p>An infinite, randomly generated puzzle game where you use cards with different abilities to copy the example image.
            Turned out pretty good, with puzzles simple to understand, but challenging to solve.
            <br><br> I made everything but the audio.

        <h3>SYN—T<time> (2024)</time></h3>
        <p>A short atmospheric adventure set on a train. Has some nice puzzles and decent worldbuilding. The station gameplay isn't very deep, 
            but it works fine as a part of the game loop.
            <br><br> I was a designer and a programmer, and managed a team of 8.

        <h3>GOBLINOMICON<time> (2023)</time></h3>
        <p>Goblins and humans try to kill each other; you can use cards to change the level environment and help your units. There's a trick to it
            that takes time to figure out.
            <br><br> I was a designer and a programmer, and managed a team of 7.
            <br><br> The game was made during a game jam, and scored 6/138. <a href="https://leth4.itch.io/goblinomicon">Play</a>

        <h3>railless!<time> (2023)</time></h3>
        <p>A fun little driving game where you drift a train locomotive. When drifting, you can pick up multiple stray wagons and destroy obstacles
            with them. It's fun, but way too difficult.
            <br><br> I made everything but the audio.
            <br><br> The game was made during a game jam, and scored 584/1720. <a href="https://leth4.itch.io/railless">Play</a>

        <h3>babls!!<time> (2022)</time></h3>
        <p>A sokoban-like puzzle where you can duplicate your bubbles to clean up all the dirt on the board. Levels turned out challenging
            while being short, I'm pretty happy with those.
            <br><br> I made everything but the audio.
            <br><br> The game was made during a game jam, and scored 97/1066. <a href="https://leth4.itch.io/babls">Play</a>

        <h3>Coinks↘<time> (2023)</time></h3>
        <p>A tiny city-building puzzle. With the jam theme begin "Roles Reversed", the catch was that you have to lose all your money
            as quickly as possible. There's some strategy to it!
            <br><br> I was a designer and a programmer, and managed a team of 7.
            <br><br> The game was made during a game jam, and scored 683/6828. <a href="https://leth4.itch.io/coinks">Play</a>

        <h3>hack_me<time> (2016)</time></h3>
        <p>A predecessor to Project DeepWeb; short hacking game with a focus on being realistic and immersive. While succeeding in that,
            it wasn't very fun to play.
            <br><br> I was the game's designer and writer.
            <br><br> The game amassed over 1400 reviews. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/526740/hack_me/">Steam</a>
