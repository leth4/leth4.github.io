<h1>Making Descending</h1>
<div class="note"><time>13 Jul 2024</time>
<p>Want to try keeping a public devlog! I'm finishing up a game called Descending; it's about drills, paper, and poisonous gas.
    Feels odd do start the blog near the end, but whatever.</p>

<p>Pushed the game to a playtestable state today, and had a playtest! As usual, confirmed two things that I manage to forget every new project—that I underestimate complexity, and
    that the tutorials should be way easier than it feels like.</p>

<p>Also today the project entered the stage where I actually feel like it works! It's always easier from here—I can focus on cool designery things like pacing and
    tension and stuff.
    It also just feels good. If I started the blog earlier, all posts would instead be spiels about how nothing works. Could have entered this stage way earlier if I just pushed
    things
    I wasn't happy with to a prototype stage. Oh well!</p>

<p>Regarding the playtest itself—man did I assume that some completely obscure things will be obvious! There's at least two things that I will throw away completely—the
    game
    is
    difficult enough right now, I'm only gonna be simplifying from here.</p>

<p> I want to put more non-systemic substance into the game. Right now it's all about raw mechanical tension and not so much about vibes. Want to strike a balance between
    the two. I usually fail at it and lean way towards systemic stuff.

<p>I think temperature mechanics are fine, they just need better feedback and two posters of instructions instead of three. It feels weird if the first mechanic to learn requires two
posters though, while pressure just needs one.</p>

<p>Pressure mechanics are definetely not good. I like the switch interactions, and controlling RPM feels good, but the current system (a specific configuration adds a specific number
to the RPM, with an apply delay) is weird. The delay is also just obscure and I don't want to explain it. Maybe you look at the speed of change and stabilize based on it... sounds
solid.</p>

<p>Battery mechanics... I like that the perfomance reports have utility. I also like that the batteries are mechanically different from restarting—otherwise why even bother with them?
I should probably allow to change batteries at any point so it's actually like a downtime prevention thing. Also make getting a new battery very slow. Not sure how to properly
feedback the failed battery though; just not applying it at all will be confusing, and causing slowdowns is obtuse. Actually, just not giving a full charge should be clear enough.</p>

<p>While I'm testing the mechanics, some more things to consider.</p>

<p>There's a lot of mechanics to learn: GAS, HOLES, OUTSIDE HOLES, BATTERIES, ADVANCED BATTERIES, TEMPERATURE, PRESSURE, and MALFUNCTIONS. I don't want the game to be overly long
(well, I don't mind, but I don't think it's engaging enough to warrant it). I also don't want to throw a new mechanic into the player every day... I want some downtime to settle in. I
can actually just unlock each mechanic for one well at a time so that there's growing complexity without new tutorials. The pacing is definetely something I can only understand properly
through playtesting.</p>

<p>I want a reason to go outside a little more. Programmed a falling rock today, looks fun, so I want the player to see it properly and not just sit inside all day.
</p>

<p>The clock doesn't work at all! There's no sense of urgency until the last few days. I'm not sure if I can just solve it with balancing, since there's a very large gap between perfect
play and relaxed play. Because there's no sense of urgency, all the problems just feel mildly annoying instead of life-threatening. Maybe I can connect some control panel
activity to gas outside... Gas also doesn't feel scary at all, it actually does nothing apart from "please seal holes beforehand thanks".</p>

<p>The biggest problem is that the game is extremely one-dimensional. There is a cool weaving of two systems that I'm happy with, but that weaving is revealed at the beginning and
then NOTHING CHANGES until the very end. I want a gameplay twist, a horizon break, something meta near the end. Otherwise I'm just wasting the player's time after the first five
minutes.</p>
