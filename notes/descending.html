<h1>Making Descending</h1>
<div class="note"><time>13 Jul 2024</time>
<p>Taking a public devlog thing for a swing! I'm finishing up a game called Descending; it's about drills, paper, and poisonous gas.
    Feels odd do start the blog near the end, but whatever.</p>

<p>Pushed the game to a playtestable state today, and had a playtest! As usual, confirmed two things that I manage to forget every new project—that I underestimate complexity, and
    that the tutorials should be way easier than it feels.</p>

<p>Also today the project entered the stage where I actually feel like it works! It's always smooth sailing from here—I can focus on cool designery stuff like pacing and
    tension.
    It also just feels good. If I started the blog earlier, all posts would instead be spiels about how nothing works. Could have entered this stage way earlier if I just pushed
    things
    I wasn't happy with to a prototype stage. Oh well!</p>

<p>Anyway, regarding the playest itself—man did I assume that some completely obscure things will be obvious! There's at least two things that I will throw away completely—the game
    is
    difficult enough right now, I'm only gonna be simplifying from here.</p>

<p>Ah, I also want to put more non-systemic substance into the game. Right now it's all about raw mechanical tension and not so much about vibes. Want to strike a balance between
    the two. I usually fail at it and lean way towards systemic stuff.
