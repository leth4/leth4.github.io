<h1>Making Descending</h1>
<div class="note"><time>13 Jul 2024</time>
<p>Want to try keeping a public devlog! I'm finishing up a game called Descending; it's about drills, paper, and poisonous gas.
    Feels odd do start the blog near the end, but whatever.</p>

<p>Pushed the game to a playtestable state today, and had a playtest! As usual, confirmed two things that I manage to forget every new project—that I underestimate complexity, and
    that the tutorials should be way easier than it feels like.</p>

<p>Also today the project entered the stage where I actually feel like it works! It's always easier from here—I can focus on cool designery things like pacing and
    tension and stuff, instead of stumbling around in the dark. If I started the blog earlier, all posts would just be spiels about how nothing works. Could have entered this stage
    way earlier if I just pushed
    things
    I wasn't happy with to a prototype stage. Oh well!</p>

<p>I assumed a lot of completely obscure things to be obvious, and the playtest proved me very wrong. There's at least two things that I will throw away completely—the
    game
    is
    difficult enough right now, I'm only gonna be simplifying from here.</p>

<p> I want to put more non-systemic substance into the game. Right now it's all about raw mechanical tension and not so much about vibes. Want to strike a balance between
    the two. I usually fail at it and lean way towards systemic stuff.

<p>I think temperature mechanics are fine, they just need better feedback and two posters of instructions instead of three. It feels weird if the first mechanic to learn requires
    two
    posters though, while pressure just needs one.</p>

<p>Pressure mechanics are definetely not good. I like the switch interactions, and controlling RPM feels good, but the current system (a specific configuration adds a specific
    number
    to the RPM, with an apply delay) is weird. The delay is also just obscure and I don't want to explain it. Maybe you look at the speed of change and stabilize based on it...
    sounds
    solid.</p>

<p>Battery mechanics... I like that the perfomance reports have utility. I also like that the batteries are mechanically different from restarting—otherwise why even bother with
    them?
    I should probably allow to change batteries at any point so it's actually like a downtime prevention thing. Also make getting a new battery very slow. Not sure how to properly
    feedback the failed battery though; just not applying it at all will be confusing, and causing slowdowns is obtuse. Actually, just not giving a full charge should be clear
    enough.</p>

<p>While I'm testing the mechanics, some more things to consider.</p>

<p>There's a lot of mechanics to learn: GAS, HOLES, OUTSIDE HOLES, BATTERIES, ADVANCED BATTERIES, TEMPERATURE, PRESSURE, and MALFUNCTIONS. I don't want the game to be overly long
    (well, I don't mind, but I don't think it's engaging enough to warrant it). I also don't want to throw a new mechanic into the player every day... I want some downtime to
    settle in. I
    can actually just unlock each mechanic for one well at a time so that there's growing complexity without new tutorials. The pacing is definetely something I can only understand
    properly
    through playtesting.</p>

<p>I want a reason to go outside a little more. Programmed a falling rock today, looks fun, so I want the player to see it properly and not just sit inside all day.
</p>

<p>The clock doesn't work at all! There's no sense of urgency until the last few days. I'm not sure if I can just solve it with balancing, since there's a very large gap between
    perfect
    play and relaxed play. Because there's no sense of urgency, all the problems just feel mildly annoying instead of life-threatening. Maybe I can connect some control panel
    activity to gas outside... Gas also doesn't feel scary at all, it actually does nothing apart from "please seal holes beforehand thanks".</p>

<p>The new control panel mechanics seem to work fine as this point. Now experimenting with the pacing—will hold a playtest
    tomorrow to see how it feels.</p>

<p>What is the vibe that I want the game to have? Initial concept was methodical, but the design naturally went into the direction of being somewhat frantic. I think what I
    want is CONTRAST. Action-packed days followed by slow, more relaxed ones; tension & release, play & narrative.</p>

<p>Went for a walk and thought I had a neat solution for a few of my problems—just have the gas downstairs as well, making it inaccessible during a storm, and forcing you to plan
    more carefully. Went to implement it and realized it's incompatible with a visual decision I really like (the see-through grating on the floor would pass gas through). Was very
    frustrating
    and discouraging. Luckily, came up with a similar idea that seems to work fine—gas can sometimes tear the paper off!</p>

<p>This solves most of the problems mentioned before: lack of pressure, outside being useless, gas not doing much. I do have a worm in my brain begging me to find one more
    gameplay twist; I am considering continuing the game for a bit after the story twist, or making an alternative ending you can discover... but I don't think that's reasonable.
    Maybe
    it's okay for the game to just be what it is.</p>

<p>One big thing left (apart from actually pushing the direction over the finish line; very high-resistance activity) is the narrative. Morgan had an idea with a journal you can
    discover in a hidden locker,
    and I think that's sick. I can also tape some papers to the falling rocks, or have cryptic messages on the instructions that can reveal secret control panel
    codes. What do I want to say with it, though? As it stands, the game's story is annoyingly, painfully cliche. I'd like to make the sub-narrative have something special in it...
    just have to find what it is, I guess.</p>

</div>

<div class="note"><time>16 Jul 2024</time>
<p>Right now the story is the classic "EVIL CORPORATION USES YOU THEN THROWS YOU AWAY". It's definitely not deeply interesting, just serviceable. What can I say with the sub-story?
    "Wow, it really sucks to be abused by an evil company"? "Actually, I'm the evil one"? "Actually, it's for the greater good"? "Actually, someone's good trying to help me"? None
    of
    those really speak to me, I don't care.</p>

<p>I think I care about personal stories. Can I make the narrative be about the previous guy? You find his notes, you get letters addressed to him. A good person, easy to care
    about.
    Leaving tips for the player. When the ending hits, you discover his last note; referencing your gameplay actions, having some message. Stronger punch for the large
    narrative and a proper climax for the personal one.</p>

<p>There's no need for an alternative ending, because the story isn't even about you at all. I like it.</p>

<p>Currently in the "it's so over" stage of the devlopment cycle.</p>

<p>For the last two days just quickly iterated—running through the game, writing down problems, fixing them, and running through the game again. The thing doesn't really seem to
work, everything is way too complicated, underexplained, annoying. Still ran a playtest to not get too caught up in my own head; sure enough, it's really bad.</p>

<p>From here I think the only thing I can do is radical simplification, both in complexity and difficulty. Take my neat interconnected system and disassemble it, make it unattractive
but serviceable, dig for the one core thing in the design that I enjoy and throw away as many other thing as I can... I've got some thinking to do. I've built up some trust in the process over the years, but this game is probably the most systemically complicated thing I made yet. Just
need to push through I guess.</p>
