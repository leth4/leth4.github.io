<h1>Making Quarter Lie</h1>
<div class="note"><time>08 Jun 2024</time>
<p>I'm working on a narrative game about a fake exorcist on a demon-ridden ship. Once again, starting a small angsty blog near the end of the development.</p>

<p>Well, at least I hope it's nearing the end. I've been struggling to finish this game for a very long time; since fall last year I keep thinking "in the next few months it will
    be
    done
    <i>for sure</i>", and then it just doesn't happen. The design is pretty much done (although time will tell if it actually withstands the test of becoming real), the art is
    pretty
    much done, the music is getting there. What's left, apart from polish and playtesting and stuff, is WRITING THE THING. I deliberately came up with a heavily narrative game to
    force myself to learn
    to
    write since I'm very bad at it. Turns out—doesn't lead to a quick and easy development process.
</p>

<p>The struggle really is very simple at its core: I'm having trouble forcing myself to write. If only I sit down and write <i>something</i> for some amount of hours, the game will
    soon be
    done
    and I will be free to move on. So I guess this blog will mostly be about (overcoming) that struggle, more so than about the game's design; but we'll see.</p>

<p>I want to have all texts done (but not necessarily super finalized) by the end of July.</p>

<p>There's nine characters in the game, each with 4–6 separate dialogues, plus some narrative scaffolding around. So fifty dialogues, give or take. How many are done? None! There's not even one dialogue <i>draft</i> that can be considered finished. I have the structure figured out and I have the characters
    outlines, but I do not have any text.</p>

<p>So... yeah. The goal for tomorrow is to make first simple drafts for the Doctor's dialogues (at least a few). I'm starting today by outlining thoroughly
    what happens inside, before jumping into actual text. Let's see how it goes.</p>
