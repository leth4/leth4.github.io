<h2>Project DeepWeb<time> (2020)</time></h2>

<p>A narrative adventure game about exploring deep corners of the internet. It features a semi-linear storyline of going deeper and deeper to save
    someone, and has a lot of little side character stories, discovered through their websites and dialogue logs. There's puzzle elements every
    once in a while, too.</p>

        <h3>GOBLINOMICON<time> (2023)</time></h3>
        <p>Goblins and humans try to kill each other; you choose one of the three cards to put on a field and change its tiles, making the
            battlefield more favorable for your units.
            <br><br> I was a designer and a programmer in a team of 7.
            <br><br> The game scored 6/138. <a href="https://leth4.itch.io/goblinomicon">Play</a>

        <h3>railless!<time> (2023)</time></h3>
        <p>A fun little driving game where you drift with a train locomotive. When drifting, you can pickup stray wagons with your last wagon and
            destroy obstacles. The difficulty was too much, though.
            <br><br> I made everything but the audio.
            <br><br> The game scored 584/1720. <a href="https://leth4.itch.io/railles">Play</a>

        <h3>Coinksâ†˜<time> (2023)</time></h3>
        <p>A tiny city-building puzzle. With the jam theme "Roles Reversed", the catch was that you have to lose all your money as quickly as possible.
            There's some strategy to it!
            <br><br> I was a designer and a programmer in a team of 7.

        <h3>babls!!<time> (2022)</time></h3>
        <p>A sokoban-like puzzle where you can duplicate your bubbles to clean up all the dirt on the board. Levels turned out pretty challenging
            while being short, I'm pretty happy with those.
            <br><br> I made everything but the audio.
