<p>A narrative adventure game about exploring deep corners of the internet. It features a semi-linear storyline of going deeper and deeper to save

        <p>A minimal atmospheric puzzle adventure about extending walls the a correct order. Turned out nicely and was well-received by players.

        <h3>Cement<time> (2023)</time></h3>
        <p>An infinite, randomly generated puzzle game where you use cards with different abilities to copy the example image.
            Turned out pretty good, with puzzles simple to understand, but challenging to solve.
            <br><br> I made everything but the audio.

        <h3>SYNâ€”T<time> (2024)</time></h3>
        <p>A short atmospheric adventure set on a train. Has some nice puzzles and decent worldbuilding. The station gameplay isn't very deep, but works fine as a part of the game
            loop.
            <br><br> I was a designer and a programmer, and managed a team of 8.
            <br><br> The game was made during a game jam, and scored 146/791. <a href="https://leth4.itch.io/goblinomicon">Play</a>

        <h3>GOBLINOMICON<time> (2023)</time></h3>
        <p>Goblins and humans try to kill each other; you can use cards to change the level environment and help your units. There's a trick to it
            that takes time to figure out.
            <br><br> I was a designer and a programmer, and managed a team of 7.

        <h3>railless!<time> (2023)</time></h3>
        <p>A fun little driving game where you drift a train locomotive. When drifting, you can pick up multiple stray wagons and destroy obstacles
            with them. It's fun, but way too difficult.
            <br><br> I made everything but the audio.

        <h3>babls!!<time> (2022)</time></h3>
        <p>A sokoban-like puzzle where you can duplicate your bubbles to clean up all the dirt on the board. Levels turned out challenging
            while being short, I'm pretty happy with those.
            <br><br> I made everything but the audio.

        <h3>hack_me<time> (2016)</time></h3>
        <p>A predecessor to Project DeepWeb; short hacking game with a focus on being realistic and immersive. While succeeding in that,
            it wasn't very fun to play.
            <br><br> I was the game's designer and writer.
            <br><br> The game amassed over 1400 reviews. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/526740/hack_me/">Steam</a>
