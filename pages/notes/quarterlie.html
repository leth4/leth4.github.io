[Making Quarter Lie] from [Notes]

{07 Jun 2025}

<p>I'm working on a narrative game about a fake exorcist on a demon-ridden ship. Once again, starting a small angsty blog near the end of the development.</p>

<p>Well, at least I hope it's nearing the end. I've been struggling to finish this game for a very long time; since fall last year I keep thinking "in the next few months it will
    be
    done
    <i>for sure</i>", and then it just doesn't happen. The design is pretty much done (although time will tell if it actually withstands the test of becoming real), the art is
    pretty
    much done, the music is getting there. What's left, apart from polish and playtesting and stuff, is WRITING THE THING. I deliberately came up with a heavily narrative game to
    force myself to learn
    to
    write since I'm very bad at it. Turns out—doesn't lead to a quick and easy development process.
</p>

<p>The struggle really is very simple at its core: I'm having trouble forcing myself to write. If only I sit down and write <i>something</i> for some amount of hours, the game will
    soon be
    done
    and I will be free to move on. So I guess this blog will mostly be about (overcoming) that struggle, more so than about the game's design; but we'll see.</p>

<p>I want to have all texts done (but not necessarily super finalized) by the end of July.</p>

<p>There's nine characters in the game, each with 4–6 separate dialogues, plus some narrative scaffolding around. So fifty dialogues, give or take. How many are done? None! There's
    not even one dialogue <i>draft</i> that can be considered finished. I have the structure figured out and I have the characters
    outlines, but I do not have any text.</p>

<p>So... yeah. The goal for tomorrow is to make first simple drafts for the Doctor's dialogues (at least a few). I'm starting today by outlining thoroughly
    what happens inside, before jumping into actual text. Let's see how it goes.</p>

{END}

<p>I wrote something! Was actually pretty enjoyable once I got into flow. Managed to draft two of the doctor's dialogues, 2000 words in total.</p>

<p>I have no idea currently if any of it is good at all. There's some fun things in there and I hit the beats I wanted to hit, but it's all still too fresh for me to judge. Either
    way,
    I'm happy with the progress. Two is more than zero.</p>

<p>The main thing I'm left thinking about is <i>branching</i>. When I play narrative games, I generally do not care about having a lot of choices, or my choices "mattering". I
    like to have a way to express myself, but I don't want every word choice to sprawl into a completely different world. I also never replay narrative games.</p>

<p>So I went and did the opposite of what I like for the second dialogue. Four completely different branches, each with its own tone, resources to gain, side of the character to
    show.
    That's
    just the natural direction the process led me; I imagine that's how something like Disco Elysium was written ("what if he does that? okay, and then what if..." forever).</p>

<p>And that just isn't working for me.
<ul>
    <li>I don't have enough resourses to write a bunch of texts that most players will just not ever see. I have to be frugal with my writing.
    <li>With all the resource management happening in the game, the breadth of choices will get too complicated to manage. I want to believe my elegant little system will allow for
        a lot of variance, but realistically, it won't; I'll have to direct it in some way.
    <li>It's very difficult to keep consistent tone within the dialogue. If the setup for the exchange leads to something dramatic, I want it to be dramatic; and if it leads to
        something funny and lighthearted, I want it to be that. But then I can't branch these two back into the main line without writing a bunch of extra text or messing up the
        tone.
    <li>Each exchange happened to reveal a different side of the character, which is great and is what I wanted. The thing is... all of these sides are important, and I want the
        player
        to learn most of them. The way it is, the player will only know 30% of the character by the time I'm trying to cash that character in.
</ul>
</p>

<p>So I need to figure out a different way. What I should probably do is make each interaction its own day. You get to choose what happens on a specific meeting, but you will
    eventually hit all the beats. It still leads to extra complexity (I have to manage all the possible orders of operations), but at least it's somewhat frugal. So more (or not)
    total dialogues, but each is somewhat shorter.</p>

<p>I'm finding it difficult to take advice about the game. Big part of it is just ego; not the most productive feeling, but it is there nonetheless.</p>

<p>Another part is... I don't like my problems being solved for me. Sure it leads to a better game, but I'm not learning as much in the process. The whole point of doing all
    the
    programming and management and other scaffolding is to get design problems to solve and reflect on the solutions. I don't want to outsource the only part that actually deeply
    matters to me.</p>

<p>I also think it has to do with authorship. I don't mind taking design advice as much at my job, and that's probably because I don't think of the game as "mine" to begin
    with; it's someone else's. And then... "my" thing has to have my decisions in it.</p>

<p>Probably would make me a horrible collaborator to someone as invested in game design (haven't tried that yet); definetely makes me a horrible mentee.</p>
