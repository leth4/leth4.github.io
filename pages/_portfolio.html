<h2>Jam Games</h2>

        <h3>Coinks</h3>
        <p>A tiny city-building puzzle. With the jam theme "Roles Reversed", the catch was that you have to lose money as quickly as possible.
            The nice little optimal strategy that people usually only discover on the first attempt is to just buy expensive buildings instead of
            just using a money-burning one.
            <br><br> I was a designer and a programmer in a team of 7.

        <h3>babls!!</h3>
        <p>A sokoban-like puzzle where you can duplicate your bubbles to clean up all the dirt on the board. Levels turned out pretty challenging
            while being short, I'm pretty happy with those.
            <br><br> I did everything but the audio.
            <br><br> The game scored 43/1066 in Game Design and 97/1066 overall.
