        <h3>Cement<time> (2023)</time></h3>
        <p>An infinite, randomly generated puzzle game where you use cards with different abilities to copy the example image.
            Turned out pretty good, with puzzles simple to understand, but challenging to solve.
            <br><br> I made everything but the audio.

        <h3>Maintenance<time> (2024)</time></h3>
        <p>A minimal atmospheric puzzle adventure about extending walls in the correct order. It's fairly short, with simple elegant puzzles and decent pacing.
            <br><br> I made this game by myself during a game jam, and it scored 4/948 in gameplay, got played over 7000 times across various platforms, and was featured on <a

        <h3>SYN—T<time> (2024)</time></h3>
        <p>A short atmospheric adventure set on a train. Has some nice puzzles and decent worldbuilding. The station gameplay isn't very deep,
            but it works fine as a part of the game loop.
            <br><br> I was a programmer and a designer in a team of 8.

        <h3>railless!<time> (2023)</time></h3>
        <p>A fun little driving game where you drift a train locomotive. When drifting, you can pick up multiple stray wagons and destroy obstacles
            with them. It's fun, but way too difficult.
            <br><br> I made everything but the audio.
            <br><br> The game was made during a game jam, and scored 584/1720. <a href="https://leth4.itch.io/railless">Play</a>

        <h3>babls!!<time> (2022)</time></h3>
        <p>A sokoban-like puzzle where you can duplicate your bubbles to clean up all the dirt on the board. Levels turned out challenging
            while being short, I'm pretty happy with those.
            <br><br> I made everything but the audio.
            <br><br> The game was made during a game jam, and scored 97/1066. <a href="https://leth4.itch.io/babls">Play</a>
